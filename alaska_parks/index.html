		<intro>
			<p> Alaska National Parks provide access to a wealth of natural, cultural, and historic features in a largely untouched setting. The number of tourists visiting Alaska has been steadily increasing over the past 10 years. Visitors come to see the wildlife, mountains, glaciers, and to learn about Alaska's history. </p>

			<p> Alaska's spectacular scenery extends from the Inupiat Heritage Center at the rooftop of the world to the Aleutian World War II National Historic area located at Alaska's southern tip. </p>
